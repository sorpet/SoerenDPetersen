# Presentations

Here is a list of available presentations, sorted by date:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Define the folder path where presentations are stored
presentations_dir <- "presentations/"

# List all files in the presentations folder
presentations <- list.files(path = presentations_dir, pattern = "*.html", full.names = FALSE)

# Sort presentations by date (assuming filenames start with a date in YYYY-MM-DD format)
presentations <- sort(presentations, decreasing = TRUE)

# Generate links to each presentation
for (file in presentations) {
  # Extract the presentation date and title from the filename
  date <- substr(file, 1, 10)
  title <- gsub("_", " ", substr(file, 12, nchar(file) - 5)) # Removes the date and ".html"
  
  # Create a markdown link for each presentation
  cat(paste0("- [", date, ": ", title, "](", presentations_dir, file, ")\n"))
}

```
