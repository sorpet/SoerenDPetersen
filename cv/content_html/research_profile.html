<p>My research centers on accelerating the discovery of antimicrobials and medicinally relevant compounds through high-throughput experimentation, structured data capture, and AI-assisted analysis. With six years of wet lab experience followed by five years as a postdoc, I’ve learned that success in bioengineering often hinges not only on biological insight but also on the number of trials and the ability to test many hypotheses systematically. This calls for a transformation of the knowledge cycle—Design, Build, Test, Learn (DBTL)—into a scalable, efficient, and integrated process.</p>
<p>At the core of my approach is the development and deployment of Teemi (publication no <a href="#pub-11">11</a>), a digital tool I designed to streamline experimental planning and execution across DBTL stages. Teemi supports the unambiguous design and automated execution of protocols and enables structured experience capture and sharing. It integrates AI for hypothesis generation and evaluation, and supports programmatic robotic instructions, aligning closely with the strategic ambitions outlined in DTU Bioengineering’s 2026–2029 plan. The use of Teemi has already expanded to the <a href="https://www.bioengineering.dtu.dk/research/research-sections/section-for-synthetic-biology/eukaryotic-molecular-cell-biology">Eukaryotic Molecular Cell Biology research group</a> at the Section for Synthetic Biology, DTU Bioengineering, as well as to the <a href="https://www.biosustain.dtu.dk/research/research-areas/natural-products/natural-products-genome-mining">Natural Products Genome Mining research group</a> at The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability at DTU (DTU Biosustain; publication no <a href="#pub-14">14</a>).</p>
<p>Since joining the Section for Synthetic Biology at DTU Bioengineering, I have focused on harnessing the potential of the IBT fungal strain collection for high-throughput screening of natural products, particularly in the context of discovering novel antimicrobials and biofungicides. This effort was part of the larger initiative Smarter AgroBiological Screening (SABS), where Teemi played an integral role in structuring and executing systematic experimentation. Building on this success, Teemi is now planned to have a similar role in the upcoming Initiative for Biofertilizer Innovation and Science (IBIS), supporting scalable compound screening across multiple stages of the DBTL cycle. These efforts align closely with DTU’s strategic focus areas: Fungi as a Bioresource and Novel Antimicrobials, and reinforce the department’s commitment to combining biological discovery with computational and robotic technologies.</p>
<p>I have contributed to pathway engineering efforts aimed at enabling sustainable microbial production of medicinally relevant compounds. These include monoterpenoid indole alkaloids (MIAs) as part of the MIAMI project (publication nos <a href="#pub-5">5</a> and <a href="#pub-11">11</a>), $\beta$-carotene (vitamin A precursor) biosynthesis (publication no. <a href="#pub-2">2</a>), and vitamin B1 (thiamine) production (publication no. <a href="#pub-1">1</a>). </p>
<p>Looking forward, I envision a research pipeline where AI-driven protocols (e.g., Teemi) are executed by robotic systems, supported by rich datasets from genome-sequenced isolates and multi-omics analyses. These activities build on DTU’s investments in automation, AI, and high-throughput technologies and are designed to dovetail with initiatives like the DTU Arena for Life Science Automation (DALSA) and collaborations with clinical partners such as Technical University Hospital (TUH).</p>
<p>This vision of systematic medicinal compound discovery is technically underpinned by tools I’ve developed, and strategically aligned with DTU Bioengineering’s mission to address planetary and human health challenges through mission-driven, interdisciplinary research.</p>
