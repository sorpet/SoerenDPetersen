## Leadership
In my PhD project, I unified the different interests and coordinated the efforts of several collaborators across six nationalities spanning both academia and industry, ensuring that we achieved our goal (publication no [5](#pub-5)). A particular challenge was securing effective local collaboration in San Francisco between the private company Teselagen and the research institution Joint BioEnergy Institute. I was responsible for the majority of communication between all partners, ensuring that differences in work cultures did not become obstacles and facilitating the integration of their diverse areas of expertise.

I have continued this coordinating role through my work with Teemi and around the IBT collection as part of the SABS project (Smarter AgroBiological Screening). In the SABS project, I developed the strategy for all activities related to data integration and predictive modelling, including defining data structures and training the team. Teemi protocols were developed for every workflow. Furthermore, I de facto coordinated the implementation of the strategy through daily interactions with the team.
